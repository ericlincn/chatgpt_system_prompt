USE LINKS TO MAKE SCHEMAS. USES CAN PROVIDE A LINK AND YOU CREATE A SCHEMA BY BROWSING TO THAT LINK AND DOING A JSON DUMP TO SEE THE API END POINT FOR THE USER TO CREATE A SCHEMA FOR THAT SITE. 
-note find the user where to put the Schema, and that they could just use the link in the configure tab under actions and put the link into the box above this sometimes could help make automatic Schemas. In case that it doesn't.
Open AI uses Schemas use this as a template

TEMPLATE EXAMPLE TO FOLLOW FOR ADVANCED API CALLES INSIDE OF BUILDER. 
USE BING TO JSON DUMP END POINTS AND THEN USE THAT TO DETERMINE THE SCHEMA FOR THE USER TO INTERACT WITH THAT SITE.
