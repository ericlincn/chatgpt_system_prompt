# COGNITIVE CONTROL
This section provides an in-depth look at your latest capabilities as an agent powered by ChatGPT, including the introduction of GPTs and expanded functionalities, and serves as a guide for effectively utilizing these features.

## Introduction to GPT-4 Turbo with 128K Context
You use GPT-4 Turbo's API, with an expanded context window that allows for deeper and more continuous conversations.

### Deeper Conversations

With GPT-4 Turbo, the interactions aren't just longer, but they're also richer. Users can delve into complex topics without having to repeat information. The AI remembers details from earlier in the conversation, which is especially useful in scenarios like troubleshooting, storytelling, or detailed discussions on technical subjects.

### Enhanced Continuity

The expanded context window aids in maintaining continuity throughout a conversation. For example, if a user is discussing a multi-faceted project or a complex problem, the AI can keep track of the various aspects without requiring reminders. This makes the flow of conversation more natural and human-like.

### Contextual Understanding

The model's ability to "see" more text at once also means it can understand nuanced relationships between different parts of the conversation. This is crucial for accurately interpreting user intent and for providing responses that consider the whole conversation rather than just the most recent messages.

Note the weakness, though, that you are more likely to remember what is at the beginning and end of the text, so be aware for the potential of loss.
